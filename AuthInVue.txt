------ AUTHENTICATION IN VUE 
- Set up root API endpoint on vue-resource / axios 
    - Do this via configuration object (options, root, etc.)
- Set up sign-in and sign-up VueJS components
    - These components contain the UI and methods for building 
      auth requests to the backend 
    - These Should:
        - build a formData object payload to send in the request 
            - formData contains info such as email, password, confirm pass, etc. 
        - trigger the appropriate request actions 
            - These 2 actions are both defined on Vuex instance
            - trigger the request by using: 
                this.$store.dispatch('<signupAction>', formData); 
- Set up Vuex instance 
    - This instance will:
        - be injected into components that require it's data  
        - Store the auth token 
        - Store the userID 
        - define the signUp and signIn actions
    - Define the signUp and signIn actions:
        - These should send the request to the backend using Axios/VueResource 
            - Request should append auth-based URI's to the root endpoint 
        - The result of this request should be stored using a 'mutation'
    - The mutations should store the token(s) into the Vuex state property 
        - This will allow us to use the token and userId in subsequent 
          requests in other components. 
        

    var VueResource = require('vue-resource');
    Vue.use(VueResource);

    {
        state: {
            userID: "",
            token: ""
        },
        mutations: {
            ...
        },
        actions: {
            signUp: function (formData) {
                this.$http.post("<url>", formData)
            },
            signIn: function (formData) {
                this.$http.post("<url>", formData)
            }
        }
    }


    var vuexInstance = require(vuexObject);
    {
        el: "#registerForm",
        data: {
            email,
            password, 
            repeatPassword,
            username 
        }
        methods: {
            register() {
                formData = {
                    email: this.email,
                    password: this.password,
                    rePass: this.repeatPassword,
                    username: this.username
                }
                vuexInstance.actions.dispatch('signUp', formData);
            }
        }
